 Run and Test the Application
Make sure you have the SQLite library and CherryPy installed, and then run the application. You can test it using curl or any similar tool:

To convert and store an input:
bash
Copy code
curl "http://localhost:8080/convert?input_str=abc"
To retrieve the conversion history:
bash
Copy code
curl "http://localhost:8080/history"
Explanation of the Code
Modular Design: The conversion logic is separated into its own file (conversion_logic.py), keeping the conversion function isolated from the web server logic.
Database Operations: The application handles all database interactions such as connecting, creating tables, inserting records, and fetching history directly in main.py, interfacing with the database using SQLite.
CherryPy Setup: The application exposes two endpoints: one for converting strings and storing the results (convert) and another for retrieving the conversion history (history).
This setup maintains a clean separation between the conversion logic and the API/web server logic, making it easier to manage and extend each part of your application independently.
